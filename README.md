## Overview

SmartVote is an innovative voting system built on Ethereum blockchain technology, leveraging the power of smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and decentralized voting processes. This application provides a user-friendly interface for participating in blockchain-based voting events.

## Key Features

- Decentralized voting using Ethereum smart contracts
- Transparent and immutable vote records
- Secure voter authentication
- Real-time vote counting and results
- Customizable voting parameters for different scenarios

## How It Works

SmartVote utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to create a trustless voting environment. Each vote is recorded as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering. Our system allows for various voting mechanisms, from simple yes/no decisions to more complex multi-candidate elections.
